/**
 * Authenticated tenant-site wrapper around the universal platform gateway
 * client (`platformCall`). Resolves the caller's PaaS site and API token
 * from the session — the same resolution `getPaaSClient` performs — and
 * executes `cmd` through the single `rokct.platform.api` entry point.
 *
 * `cmd` is the target module's manifest `whitelisted_methods` key with the
 * leading `{app_name}.` stripped (e.g. `api.order.create_order`); the
 * gateway resolves it against the composed app's whitelist server-side.
 *
 * Throws on failure (unauthorized session or failed gateway call) so
 * existing try/catch call sites keep their error semantics.
