// The page that serves `/` in a shell whose home SDK is delivery_sdk. Same
// role as lms_sdk's app/page.tsx for Supacharge and agent_sdk's
// app/(chat)/page.tsx for rokctapp: the home SDK owns the root route (Ray,
// 2026-09-03: each home SDK holds its own landing page). It lands on
// app/(chat)/page.tsx rather than app/page.tsx because that is where the
// delivery-frontend shell keeps its holding copy of `/` (its own comment:
// moving it to app/page.tsx would leave two "/" routes at compose time), so
// the composer overwrites the shell copy instead of colliding with it.
//
// Ray, 2026-09-09: the landing "will be selling a delivery platform not
// selling to merchants, his portal is the one that sell to merchants". So
// `/` does three things and no more:
//
//  1. A signed-in session goes to the tenant portal - base_sdk's manager
//     shell at /manager (the paas-era /paas/dashboard, which base_sdk 1.2.0
//     carries as app/manager/layout.tsx and app/manager/page.tsx).
//  2. A visitor who names a tenant (`?site_name=`) - or arrives on a
//     tenant's own domain, which base's tenant-host lookup maps to a site
//     (ROKCT_TENANT_HOSTS or a registered resolver) - gets auth_sdk's
//     PaaSLogin, the tenant login form. The host case is answered by a
//     redirect carrying the resolved site so PaaSLogin reads it the one way
//     it knows, from the query.
//  3. Everyone else goes to base_sdk's composed landing at /landing: the
//     storefront that sells the platform.
//
// The session is read through the kernel seam (app/services/base/session.ts),
// never through app/(auth) directly, so this page builds identically with
// and without the auth surface installed.
