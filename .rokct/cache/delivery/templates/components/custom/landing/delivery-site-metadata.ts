// The juvo storefront's site metadata, for base_sdk's
// site-metadata registry (components/custom/landing/site-metadata.ts,
// base_sdk >= 1.15.0): the <title>, description and social-card facts the
// host layout, the landing page and the generated Open Graph / Twitter
// image read from ONE registered module.
//
// The shape is written out here rather than imported from base's file, as
// hosting-site-metadata.ts, lms-site-metadata.ts and agent-site-metadata.ts
// do: an `import type` of a module that is not on disk is a compile error,
// and the registry checks the default export structurally when it loads
// this module.
//
// No `icon`: the SDK ships no icon file, so base_sdk >= 1.17.0 draws the
// fallback favicon (the domain's first letter) itself. No `still`, no `logo`,
// no `ogImage`: there is no delivery artwork in the sources, and base's
// generated card draws the tagline on its own. Every claim in the
// description is a source fact:
// the two delivery services (zones/delivery/docs, terms 1.1 and 1.2), the
// Driver app's dispatch and delivery-zone screens (paas_driver feature
// guide), the PaaS plan fixtures' feature lines (white label, WhatsApp order
// integration, parcel tracking sync, digital wallet), USD, Monthly and
// Yearly, and trial_period_days 14 on the yearly record.
//
// The name and the URL are Ray's ruling of 2026-09-09: "deliveryplatform
// will be juvo so i will point juvo.app to it". `siteName` is "juvo"
// exactly as he wrote it - lower-case, no wordmark, no tagline of its own
// and no capitalisation invented here (paas_customer's own README titles
// the customer app "Juvo"; the storefront keeps Ray's spelling) - and
// `url` is https://juvo.app, the host he named, so base's canonical and
// social-card URLs resolve there instead of the shell's NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.
// The title leads with the site name the way hosting's and lms's do. The
// terms document is a South African one (POPIA, rand), hence the locale.
