// The three apps the juvo storefront shows off, for the apps section
// (components/custom/delivery-apps-section.tsx) and the header's apps
// group (landing/delivery-header-menu.ts). Ray, 2026-09-09:
// "deliveryplatform will show off three apps paas_customer, paas_manager,
// paas_driver as customer, manager, delivery apps with downloads and demo
// account details for potentials to try them."
//
// The shape is lms 1.12.0's LMS_APPS / LMS_SHOWN_APPS (RokctAI/agent,
// lms/nextjs/templates/components/custom/landing/lms-landing-config.ts):
// one data array, a `shown` flag per platform build, and ONE filtered
// view every surface reads, so the section and the header can never
// disagree about which downloads exist. iOS sits in every list with
// shown: false (Ray, 2026-09-09: "ios is demoted for now") and reaches no
// surface.
//
// Every href is the app's releases PAGE,
// https://github.com/RokctAI/<repo>/releases/latest, the choice lms 1.4.1
// and 1.12.0 made: the assets are named per version (paas_manager and
// paas_driver v1.2.9 carry app-v1.2.9.apk, app-v1.2.9.aab and
// app-windows-v1.2.9.zip), so no releases/latest/download/<file> link is
// stable. No Play or App Store link exists in any source, so none is
// shown: each repo's play-deploy.yml pushes to the Play "internal" track,
// which has no public listing, and marketing/store/listing/en-US/*.txt in
// all three repos still holds only its template comments.
//
// Which builds are shown is what each repo's RELEASE lane publishes
// (.github/workflows/release.yml, the inputs it hands
// RokctAI/shared-workflows universal-pipeline.yml), never what its CI
// build.yml can build: paas_customer declares build_android only,
// paas_manager build_android and build_windows, paas_driver build_android
// and build_hms. A platform with no release lane keeps its entry with
// shown: false and a `// gap:` note naming what is missing.
//
// Every word of a description is the app's own, from its
// marketing/tour/feature-guide.md (the tagline under the title and its
// "Welcome" line) or its README, named beside it. The card labels are
// Ray's words for the three apps.
//
// The try-it block (the one surface that may say "demo account", because
// Ray asked for those details here) is rendered from environment variable
// NAMES only. The mechanism it describes exists: users_sdk 1.3.8 (the
// Frappe half, RokctAI/Users users/frappe/fixtures/
// custom_field_user_is_demo_account.json) marks a real account on the
// production backend `is_demo_account`, and auth_sdk 1.11.0 / base_sdk
// 1.61.0 (`DemoSession`) switch the apps to their in-app demo data when
// that account signs in - delivery 1.22.0's driver facades follow it. But
// "nothing seeds an account: an operator ticks the box on the User form of
// the account they choose", the apps' login screens render no credentials
// hint, and the tour's `*@demo.rokct.ai` addresses live only in
// auth_sdk's MockAuthRepository, which a release build compiles out. So
// no source spells a production demo login, and this SDK never writes
// one: the deployment sets the variables below, the block renders what
// they hold, and hides itself entirely while they are unset. NEXT_PUBLIC_
// values are inlined into the client bundle at build time, so they must be
// set where the shell is built.
